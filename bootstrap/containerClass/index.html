					We're all falling and we need a place to hide
					A safe place in THE WOODS, where we can start the fire
					All we know is that would be our home
					We will stay 'till the break of dawn

					The cold night takes us to a place to escape the chill
					Top top, somewhere in the woods, on the hill
					Wake up, feeling the cold in between our toes
					Is there a way back? Nobody knows.

					And we live it all behind
					Can't you see we need some time?!
					And we all sit around the fire,
					We feel a little warmer now
					And we all sit around the fire,
					We feel so much better now!

					[instrumental break]

					And we all sit around the fire,
					We feel a little warmer now
					And we all sit around the fire,
					We feel so much better now!

					I'm clumsy, yeah my head's a mess
					'Cause you got me growing taller everyday
					We're giants in a little man's world
					My heart is pumping up so big that it could burst

					Been trying so hard not to let it show
					But you got me feeling like
					I'm stepping on buildings, cars and boats
					I swear I could touch the sky

					Ohhh ohh ohhh
					I'm ten feet tall
					Ohhh oh ohhhh
					I'm ten feet tall

					I'll be careful, so don't be afraid
					You're safe here, no, these arms won't let you break
					I'll put up a sign in the clouds
					So they all know that we ain't ever coming down

					Been trying so hard not to let it show
					But you got me feeling like
					I'm stepping on buildings, cars and boats
					I swear I could touch the sky

					Ohhh oh ohhh
					I'm ten feet tall
					Ohhh oh ohhhh
					I'm ten feet tall

					You build me up
					Make me what I never was
					You build me up
					From nothing into something
					Yeah, something from the dust

					Been trying so hard not to let it show
					But you got me feeling like
					I'm stepping on buildings, cars and boats
					I swear I could touch the sky

					Ohhh oh ohhh
					I'm ten feet tall
					Ohhh oh ohhhh
					I'm ten feet tall

					Ohhh oh ohhh
					I'm ten feet tall
					Ohhh oh ohhhh
					I'm ten feet tall
